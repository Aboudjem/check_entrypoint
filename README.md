# EntryPoint Check Tool 🛠️

Welcome to the EntryPoint Check Tool! This utility is designed to help our team and clients quickly verify smart contract deployment status and blockchain capabilities. 

## How It Works 🔍

Our automated tool simplifies the process of checking whether the EntryPoint contract is deployed at a specific address and if the blockchain supports pre-EIP-155 transactions.

To use the tool:
1. Visit the [EntryPoint Check Issue](https://github.com/Aboudjem/check_entrypoint/issues/1).
2. Write a comment in the format: `check <RPC_URL>` where `<RPC_URL>` is your blockchain's RPC endpoint.
3. The tool will respond with the status of the EntryPoint deployment and pre-EIP-155 transaction support.

## Features ✨

- **Automated EntryPoint Verification**: Quickly determines if the EntryPoint contract is deployed at the standard address.
- **Pre-EIP-155 Support Check**: Assesses whether the blockchain allows for pre-EIP-155 transactions, which is essential for Nick's method deployment.
